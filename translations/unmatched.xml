Second option is to go to a higher area, attack once and jump, so that the enemy clone gets hit by your attack.

You can also try equipping a weaker armor and then when the clone starts spawning, change it to a better one and kill it by brute force.\n\n

        Just follow the line made out of gold 🪙.\n\n</string>
    <string name="dungeon7bonustext2">Once you reach the highest one, jump at the top of the square and the jump in the area with the chest.\n\n
        After this, just jump back down to the next platform and finish the dungeon.\n\n</string>
    <string name="dungeon7text">Two 💎 are in the golden pots. One is in the area, which can be unlocked by clicking the button.\n\n
        Be sure to have at least one iron key for the bonus stage.\n\n

        When you finish the dungeon, be sure to check out new items in the shop.\n\n</string>
